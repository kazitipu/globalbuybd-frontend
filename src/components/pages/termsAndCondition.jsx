                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>3.1. We will provide the tracking number manually. It would take 5/7 days from your purchase request. Tracking numbers become available after the shipment of the product by the seller. Sometimes it could be late because of vacation, shipment delay or big offers. </p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>3.2. In some cases, the tracking number will not be available because of changing the name or product details by the seller. Then you will get an update after receiving the product.    </p>
                                <h3 style={{marginTop:'3rem', color:'black'}}>4. Product Receive Time:</h3>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>4.1. How many days will it take to receive the products?</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>It depends on the time given by AliExpress. Usually, they give 40 to 60 days'(At COVID situation it takes 40 to 100 days) time frame to receive the products. According to our experience, we can say that it takes 20-30 days on average to receive the products from AliExpress. Unregistered or untracked products take 30-50 days. </p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>4.2. The maximum time of reaching the product is 90(AT COVID Time Normally 65Days) days. After this period, we appeal for a refund in AliExpress even if you don’t demand to do so. Refund asking/Dispute process ‘starts’ after 90(AT COVID Time Normally 65Days) days of not receiving the product. A refund will only be given to you after AliExpress has refunded us. But if there are any critical situations like special offer time, long vacation, etc, then we suggest you be patient as in those cases most products that are untraceable reaches us even after 90((AT COVID Time Normally 65Days)) days.</p>
                               
                                <h3 style={{marginTop:'3rem', color:'black'}}>5. Tax-related Discussion:</h3>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>5.1. After reaching the product we will add the tax amount with the invoice. You will be noticed through email. Then you need to pay us before the delivery process.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>5.2. Why Ali2BD is paying taxes and then asking the purchaser to pay the amount?</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>It's needed to pay the tax immediately after reaching the products to customs. They don’t hold the product for more than 24 hours. So, there is no way to contact every single customer asking for paying tax. We pay the tax to receive the products at the right time. The customer has no chance to pay the tax directly because AliExpress sends a shipment of products to our address.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>5.3. Ali2BD will not provide you with the tax receipt because of business clearance. If you need this badly, then you can take a picture or a photocopy. You are not allowed to ask for the main copy of the tax receipt.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>5.4. It's not possible to guess the amount of tax for all products like a mobile, smartwatch, heavyweight products, shoes, etc. But we have a little bit of an idea. Sometimes this does not work at all. So, you need to pay the amount that customs authority charges for your products during the clearance process.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>5.5. We don't add tax costs during the order process stage. So, we ask our users to pay the tax after getting the notice from the Post Office in detail. We are bound to pay the amount whatever they charge for clearance.</p>
                                <h3 style={{marginTop:'3rem', color:'black'}}>6. Product Delivery:</h3>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>6.1. You can receive delivery in three ways.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>Home Delivery Inside Dhaka: Delivery charge is not included in your invoice. You need to pay the courier service after receiving the product. The delivery charge depends on the courier service’s pricing policy and it may vary from 50/- BDT to 300/- BDT depending on the package’s size and weight.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>Home Delivery/Sundarban office outside Dhaka: Delivery charge is not included in your invoice when you place the order. The delivery charge will be added to your invoice after products are received and delivery is processed. After you pay the invoice we will book the parcel for delivery at Sundarban. The charge may vary from 100/- BDT to 300/- BDT depending on the package’s size and weight.  </p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>GlobalbuyBd Office Pickup: If you are willing to take delivery physically from our office address then you can do so by changing your delivery address to the following: “Globablbuybd Office Pickup”. At the time of the delivery request, if your address is set for office to pick up, you can take delivery from us the following day, which is Sunday and Tuesday 10 AM to 6 PM. In the case of office pickup, no delivery charge is applicable.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>6.2. We use eCourier, Sundarban and MoveOn in-house Courier Service for sending your products. Every Monday & Friday is our scheduled shipment days.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>6.3. If we get all of your ordered items, automatically it will be sent to your address through couriers. Alternatively, if you request us to deliver the products which already reached out of your ordered items, then we will deliver them. The rest of them will be sent after getting them. Both of the time purchasers will pay the courier charge.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>6.4 Delivery charge is taken per delivery, not per order. You can add 5 items in a single order and take 5 times separately. In that case, you need to pay a delivery charge 5 times. Again, if you take all 5 times after they arrive and take delivery of them at once, you need to pay a delivery charge just one time.</p>
                                <h3 style={{marginTop:'3rem', color:'black'}}>7. Refund related:</h3>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>7.1. As we discussed on policy 4.2, if you don't get the ordered products within 90((AT COVID Time Normally 65Days)) days, we will start the refund process in AliExpress. But if there are any critical situations like natural disasters, long vacations, etc, we would like to suggest our users be patient.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>7.2. You can claim a partial refund(Depend on Store's Judgement) for broken products. In this case, you need to send some videos and still pictures as evidence. </p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>7.3. If the product you received is not the wrong one, but you don't like this, there is no chance of product return. AliExpress has no policy on returning products. Therefore, in our business, there is no chance for returning products.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>7.4 In case of broken, unusable or wrong product you need to provide evidence that correctly shows the problem of the received product. If AliExpress determines that your product does not deserve any refund, then you will not receive any refund.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom:'1rem'}}>7.5 in case of full or partial refund, only the product item or refund amount received from AliExpress will be refunded to your designated refund method. payment gateway charge is non-refundable</p>
